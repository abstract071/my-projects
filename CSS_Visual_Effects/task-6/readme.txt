Hide text (to place logo) with text indent

Hiding text can be extremely useful to hide company logo.
As logos are usually an image, you will want to use text indent to place it in a h1 tag for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
The technique we use is to hide the text far away off the screen, and apply a background image instead.
