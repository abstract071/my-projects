1. Rounded Corners/Borders

CSS3 has brought some really nice stuff and rounded corners is one of them.
Rounded borders can be easily made in modern browsers (Firefox3, Opera, Safari and Chrome).
IE does not support CSS3, but it is available in Microsoft IE9.


2. Border Image

Another great CSS3 feature is the border-image property.
It allows to create some new creative borders.
